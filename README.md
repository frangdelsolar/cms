# CMS Builder
This repository contains the code for a Golang - React Content Managament System, along with some useful tools for my projects.

## CMS BUILDER SERVER (Golang)
A comprehensive bootstrapping and management framework for Go applications.  `Builder` simplifies application setup by providing pre-configured components and managing their interactions, promoting consistency and reducing boilerplate.

### Features

* **Configuration Management:** Reads configuration from environment variables and/or files.
* **Logging:** Configurable logging system with different levels (debug, info, error, etc.) and optional file output. Separate log files for the main application and the scheduler.
* **Database Initialization:** Establishes database connections (supports SQLite and others via URL configuration).
* **Server Setup:** Configures and runs an HTTP server with routing and CSRF protection.
* **User Administration:** Manages application models/entities, including user accounts, registration, authentication, and authorization using roles and permissions. Includes initial admin user creation and a dedicated scheduler user.
* **File Upload Handling:** Handles file uploads with size limits, MIME type validation, and storage (local or S3 based on configuration). Manages metadata about uploaded files.
* **Scheduled Tasks:** Defines and runs scheduled jobs using various frequency specifications (immediate, scheduled, or cron). Tracks job execution status.
* **Firebase Integration:** Integrates with Firebase for authentication or other services.
* **History Tracking:** Logs database actions, including user, timestamp, resource, and resource ID for auditing.


# CMS BUILDER ADMIN (React)

The `cms-builder-admin` is a React-based front-end application designed to interact with data generated by the `builder-server` library. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing models and files, offering CRUD operations and access to history logs.

## Features

* **Models Module:**
    * Displays a list of all registered models.
    * Provides a table view for each model, enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the underlying data.
    * Includes a history log to track recent activity and changes made to each model's data.
* **File Module:**
    * Connects to configured file storage (S3 or local).
    * Lists all stored files.
    * Allows downloading and deleting files.
